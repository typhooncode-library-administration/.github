## 🎉 Welcome to TyphoonCode Library Administration

As a current student, I’ve seen firsthand how cumbersome library management can be. Multiple library cards, complex loan systems, and disconnected processes—there has to be a better way. That’s why I’m building this Library Management System, right here on GitHub, to make library experiences smoother and more intuitive for everyone. 📚

But that’s not all—this project is also a way for me to improve my web development skills across the board. Whether it’s backend, frontend, data management, or even conceptual design, I’m diving into new technologies and approaches, learning as I go and applying them in real-time.

🛠️ **Building a Smarter, Unified Library System**  
The Library Management System (LMS) is born out of a simple idea: what if one library card could give you access to all the libraries you need? This project aims to bring that vision to life, streamlining library operations and making life easier for students, staff, and the public alike. Here’s how:

- **👥 Employee and Member Management**: Simplified management of staff and members, with a focus on clear roles and permissions. No more juggling between different systems—everything you need is in one place.
- **📦 Media Inventory Management**: An all-in-one module for tracking books, magazines, and digital resources across multiple libraries. With unified inventory management, you can access what you need, where you need it.
- **💳 Loan and Fee Management**: Say goodbye to confusing loan policies. This system ensures that loans and fees are consistent, transparent, and tailored to user needs—whether you’re a student, an external member, or a general user.
- **📅 Event Scheduling and Management**: From academic workshops to community events, manage it all seamlessly with tools that cater to both members and the public.
- **📊 Reporting and Analytics**: Get real insights with powerful analytics that help libraries make informed decisions and improve their services.

🎯 **Project Motivation**  
Driven by my experiences as a student, I’ve noticed how fragmented and inefficient library systems can be. This project is my answer to those challenges—a unified, intuitive system designed to streamline library management for everyone involved. It’s an opportunity for me to not only solve a real-world problem but also to push my skills in web development, tackling everything from backend to frontend, data management, and the latest technologies. The goal is simple: create a system that works seamlessly, reducing the friction and complexity of library interactions.

### 🗓️ The Road Ahead

- **Q3 2024**: Finalizing the conceptual design and documentation. This includes completing the Software Requirements in the Wiki, detailing the ERM (Entity-Relationship Model) and its relationships, and creating the `init.sql` script to initialize the database structure. Additionally, setting up the Docker environment with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, and populating the database with dummy data for testing. By the end of the quarter, I will begin developing the backend using SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, and related technologies, focusing on implementing the core business logic, including basic API endpoints.

- **Q4 2024**: Continuing backend development with a focus on enhancing functionality. This quarter will involve deepening the integration of the business logic, refining the API endpoints, and implementing secure authentication mechanisms. Middleware components will also be developed to handle tasks such as request logging, error handling, and authorization checks. The aim is to ensure a robust and secure backend that manages user authentication and protects sensitive data. Additionally, I will open up the project for discussions, inviting feedback and insights from the community to help shape the future of the project.

- **Q1 2025**: Starting the frontend development. This includes designing a user-friendly interface that connects to the backend services. The goal is to have a basic, functional user interface that allows interaction with the core features of the system, such as managing users, media inventory, and secure login.

- **Q2 2025**: Expanding the frontend capabilities and improving user experience. This involves adding more advanced features to the UI, such as event management, reporting tools, and further refining the authentication flow for a seamless user experience.

- **Q3 2025**: Testing and refinement. Conducting thorough testing to identify and fix bugs, optimizing performance, and making final adjustments to ensure the system is robust and ready for deployment. This phase will also involve stress-testing authentication and middleware to ensure security and reliability.

- **Q4 2025**: Preparing for the first full release of the Library Management System. This includes finalizing documentation, creating user guides, and deploying the system for initial use in a test environment. Feedback from this phase will guide future updates and improvements.

### 💬 Join the Conversation
This might be a solo project, but your ideas could make a huge difference. Starting in Q4 2024, I’ll be opening up discussions to gather feedback and insights.
